## regolf

This is a simple IRC bot in Perl, made to manage regex golf games through IRC.

Typically, two sets of words will be picked, possibly similar words, and people will have to come up with the shortest regex possible to match all of the words in the first set but not in the second set.

This is currently in progress and is not fully-featured yet.
